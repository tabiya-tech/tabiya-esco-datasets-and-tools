# Tabiya - ESCO datasets and tools

## Introduction

The project contains a collection of datasets and tools designed for use with the ESCO classification system and the Tabiya Open Taxonomy Platform. 

The ESCO (European Skills, Competences, Qualifications, and Occupations) classification system is a European standard that provides a standardized and multilingual framework for describing occupations, skills, and qualifications. The ESCO classification is widely used in various industries and sectors to facilitate labor market analysis, skills matching, and career development.

The Tabiya Open Taxonomy builds and extends the ESCO classification.
